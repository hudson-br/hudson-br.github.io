Hi, I’m Hudson. I am a scientist working at the exciting interface between mechanics, physics and Biology. I am currently a postdoc at MIT in the group of [Prof. Tal Cohen](https://tal-cohen.wixsite.com/website).

Research interests
======
#### [Criticality in living systems](/projects/1_project)
I received my PhD in solid mechanics from [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) under the guidance of [Prof. Lev Truskinovsky](https://blog.espci.fr/trusk/). My research focused on criticality in living systems. Critical systems are those that are on the brink of instability – they’re kind of like a Jenga tower that’s just about to collapse. When a system is critical, it can be hard to predict what will happen next, because small perturbations can have big effects. 

#### [Mechanics of the cell](/projects/2_project)
After completing my PhD, I began my first postdoctoral appointment at [Collège de France](https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr) in the group of [Prof. Hervé Turlier]( https://www.turlierlab.com/). During this time, I delved deeper into the biological realm. My research focused on using mechanics concepts to model the behavior of the cell surface, which is crucial to understand how cells change their shape in processes such as division, motility, and embryonic development. 

#### [Fracture of soft solids](/projects/3_project)
I am currently a postdoctoral associate at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), working under the guidance of [Prof. Tal Cohen](https://tal-cohen.wixsite.com/website). My research focuses on unraveling the intricate mechanics behind damage and fracture in soft solids, specifically emphasizing cavitation. Cavitation refers to the spontaneous expansion of a cavity or defect within a solid body when subjected to a constant applied tension or internal pressure. My research combines analytical, numerical, and experimental methods to address the complexities associated with cavity expansion, fracture initiation, and the ensuing unstable response in soft solids.


<!-- Publications
======
Point to [publications](/al-folio/publications) -->

<!-- Write your biography here. <a href='#'>Affiliations</a> Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
