Hi, I’m Hudson. I am scientist working at the exciting interface between mechanics, physics and Biology. I am currently a postdoc at MIT in the group of [Prof. Tal Cohen](https://tal-cohen.wixsite.com/website).

Research interests
======
I have a broad reasearch interest. For my PhD dissertation I was interested in the way that certain patterns emerge in natural systems, and how these patterns can help us understand how the world works. One of the most important patterns that I studied is called criticality. Critical systems are those that are on the brink of instability - they're kind of like a Jenga tower that's just about to collapse. When a system is critical, it can be hard to predict what will happen next, because small changes can have big effects. [Ph.DD work](/al-folio/projects/1_project)

Publications
======
Point to [publications](/al-folio/publications)

<!-- Write your biography here. <a href='#'>Affiliations</a> Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
