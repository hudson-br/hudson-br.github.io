The actomyosin complex is a protein structure mainly composed of semi-flexible actin filaments and myosin motors. Myosin motors pull on the actin filaments, which makes the actomyosin complex contractile. In skeletal muscles, the actomyosin complex is highly ordered and stable, forming contractile units called sarcomeres, which are the basis for understanding muscle contraction. In non-muscle cells, the actomyosin complex appears as a highly disordered meshwork of actin filaments, myosin motors, and crosslinkers that are highly dynamic and undergo permanent assembly and disassembly. It composes the cell cortex, the principal regulator of the cell's shape, enabling cell motility and force generation.

#### The cell cortex
The cell cortex, a thin layer beneath the plasma membrane, imparts mechanical resistance to animal cells and drives their shape changes. My previous work involved developing a homogenized theory based on constitutive equations for incompressible active gels. Through numerical implementation using the finite-element method, I studied osmotic shocks and cell division. To achieve a more comprehensive model of the cell surface, it is crucial to consider the mechanical contributions of the plasma membrane, which possesses surface tension and bending rigidity. In a recent study, I simplified the cortex-membrane system into a single composite model to show how cell protrusion and local contraction generates long-range membrane tension transmission. The future challenge lies in the development of a comprehensive model of the cortex-membrane structure encompassing both mechanical and regulatory elements (for instance, the membrane can carry regulators of actin nucleation and growth). Preserving the complexity of this interaction, especially considering the fractal structure of the cortex and membrane, presents a challenge in capturing the essential features within the homogenized model
