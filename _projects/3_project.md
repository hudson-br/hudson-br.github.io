#### Mechanics of Damage and Fracture in Soft Solids. 

At MIT, my research investigates how fracture emerges in soft materials through bifurcation-driven instabilities. When soft solids such as gels, elastomers, or biological tissues are subjected to tension—particularly during processes like cavity expansion—they may initially deform uniformly, only to suddenly lose symmetry and localize damage in distinct patterns. This symmetry breaking signals a bifurcation: a point where the system becomes unstable and transitions from a smooth to a fractured configuration. Using a gradient damage framework coupled with nonlinear elasticity, I develop theoretical and computational tools to predict when this transition occurs and what form it takes. My work shows how material and geometric parameters—such as toughness, cavity size, and internal length scales—govern the onset and morphology of fracture, enabling mesh-independent predictions of failure. By bridging mechanics, materials science, and nonlinear stability theory, this research advances our understanding of how complex failure modes arise from simple loading conditions, with applications ranging from tissue rupture to the design of soft robotic systems.
