#### Mechanics of Damage and Fracture in Soft Solids. 

One of my current research thrusts focuses on understanding damage and fracture in soft solids, specifically emphasizing cavitation. 
Cavitation refers to the spontaneous expansion of a cavity or defect within a solid body when subjected to a constant applied tension or internal pressure. While void growth and coalescence in ductile metals have been widely studied, unraveling these processes in soft solids is a challenging task.
To bridge this knowledge gap, my research employs analytical tools, numerical simulations, and carefully designed experiments to delve into the complexities of cavity expansion, fracture initiation, and the unstable responses in these materials. To achieve this, I utilize a custom-designed experimental setup developed in our lab that functions akin to a volume-controlled syringe pump. This innovative approach allows me to precisely regulate the expansion of a cavity within a transparent PDMS sample. This technique not only enables the acquisition of accurate measurements of material properties but also provides complete control over the system from the initial crack initiation to its subsequent propagation. One of the primary objectives of my ongoing project is to characterize the intricate shapes of cracks that originate from the expansion of cavities. It involves studying the instability associated with crack formation and characterizing the observed patterns with material parameters.
