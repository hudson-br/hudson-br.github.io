The concept of criticality in living systems is borrowed from physics and refers to a delicate balance where the system operates at the edge between order and chaos. In criticality, small changes can have profound effects, leading to sudden and significant shifts in behavior or function. In biology, there is growing evidence that some living systems may exhibit similar features. For instance, coordinated motion in flocks of birds or schools of fish has been suggested to resemble critical-like dynamics, where even a slight change in the behavior of one bird can cause the entire flock's pattern to transform dramatically. This critical behavior is not limited to birds; it is present in various biological processes, such as our brains' neural activity and the beating of our hearts. Contrary to inanimate matter, where criticality is often fine-tuned, living systems appear to be poised near critical points. Scientists believe that this criticality is not just a random occurrence but serves a purpose in living systems. It may optimize information processing, enhance adaptability, and enable living organisms to respond quickly and efficiently to their ever-changing environment. Understanding criticality in living systems could open doors to new insights into health, disease, and the delicate balance that sustains life itself.
